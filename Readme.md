**Introduction 📊**
------------

Food image recognition is a challenging task in computer vision, with numerous applications in fields such as food analysis, nutrition, and culinary arts. The Food-101 dataset, comprising 101 classes of food images, provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating food image recognition models. In this experiment, I propose a deep learning approach to food image recognition using a pre-trained EfficientNetBx model.

**Methodology 📝**
--------------

My approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation 📁**: I download the Food-101 dataset and preprocess it for my model.
2. **Model Development 🤖**: I employ a pre-trained EfficientNetBx model and fine-tune it for my specific task.
3. **Model Training 📊**: I train my model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance.
4. **Model Evaluation 📊**: I test my model and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

**Key Concepts 🤔**
----------------

* **Top-1 accuracy 📊**: How well my model can predict the correct food image.
* **Top-5 accuracy 📊**: How well my model can predict the correct food image among its top 5 guesses.
* **Mixed precision training ⚡️**: A technique that optimizes model performance by utilizing mixed precision arithmetic.
* **Prefetching 📈**: A technique that optimizes model performance by prefetching data.

**Dataset 📁**
------------

* I utilize the Food-101 dataset, comprising 101 classes of food images.
* The dataset is downloaded from TensorFlow Datasets and preprocessed for my model.

**Preprocessing 📊**
----------------

* My data is currently in `uint8` data type, comprising all different sized tensors, and not scaled.
* I create a `preprocess_img()` function to resize the input image tensor, convert it to `float32` data type, and scale the values between 0 and 1.

**Model 🤖**
---------

* I employ a pre-trained EfficientNetBx model.
* The model has rescaling built-in, but I can also incorporate rescaling within my model as a `tf.keras.layers.Rescaling` layer.

**Future Work 📈**
--------------

I plan to explore other models and techniques to further improve the results, including:

* Trying other pre-trained models such as ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet
* Experimenting with different hyperparameters and optimization techniques
* Using transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt the model to other datasets
